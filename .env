# UFW Web Manager Environment Configuration Sample
# Copy this file to .env (the start script will auto-create .env if missing)
# Only variables with security impact or runtime behavior are listed.

# Initial admin password (only used on FIRST database creation).
# Change this before first run or change password via UI immediately after.
ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=ufw-admin-2024

# Set to 1 to completely disable built-in authentication (ONLY when behind a trusted
# reverse proxy + external SSO like Authentik). Never expose to the internet with auth disabled.
DISABLE_AUTH=0

# Optional one-time admin password reset token. When set, a "Forgot password?" link
# appears on the login screen. The token must be provided along with a new password.
# After resetting, REMOVE or change this value to prevent reuse. Leave unset to hide
# the link. Example (generate something random):
# ADMIN_RESET_TOKEN=RANDOM_LONG_TOKEN_VALUE
# (You can also set/change this later via the UI once settings management is added.)
ADMIN_RESET_TOKEN=7c1a1d68de3c0090d113473e5a5ef832168c8257a97694c9
